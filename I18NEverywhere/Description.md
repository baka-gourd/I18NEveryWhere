# I18n EveryWhere

Provides convenient localization features to reduce the burden on authors and provide centralized coverage.

Keeps authors from being overwhelmed by:

- Self-implemented language file loading
- Handling different text encodings

## Usage

1. Create a new "lang" folder in the mod folder.
2. Add localization json, like en-US.json, zh-HANS.json.
